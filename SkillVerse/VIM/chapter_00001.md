# Vi IMproved (VIM)


## Introduction

Vim, which stands for "Vi Improved", is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems. Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE.

Here are some key features of Vim:

1. **Modal Editing**: Vim operates in various modes, with the most commonly used ones being: normal, insert, and visual. Each mode has a different purpose and allows different kinds of commands.
2. **Efficiency**: Vim provides a multitude of keyboard shortcuts and commands that allow for fast navigation and editing.
3. **Extensibility**: Vim can be customized and extended using scripts and plugins. There are many plugins available that can add extra functionality to Vim.
4. **Ubiquity**: Vim is available on almost all modern operating systems, making it a reliable choice for developers.
