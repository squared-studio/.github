# RTL Coding Styles and Best Practices

This chapter is crucial for learning how to write effective Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code in SystemVerilog that is not only functionally correct but also synthesizable, efficient, readable, and maintainable. It covers the essential coding styles and best practices that are fundamental for successful hardware design.

*   **Synthesizable vs. Non-synthesizable SystemVerilog Constructs:**
    *   **Synthesizable Constructs:**
        - Definition: SystemVerilog code that can be translated by synthesis tools into a gate-level implementation.
        - Core Synthesizable Constructs:
            - `always` blocks (`always_comb`, `always_ff`, `always_latch` - with restrictions for `always_latch`).
            - `assign` statements (for continuous assignments).
            - `if-else`, `case` statements (within `always_comb` and `always_ff`).
            - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
            - Logical operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `&&`, `||`, `!`).
            - Relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
            - Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`).
            - Conditional operator (`? :`).
            - Instantiation of modules and primitives.
            - Parameters and generate statements (for code reusability).
        - Focus on Hardware Equivalence: Synthesizable code should have a clear and direct hardware equivalent.
    *   **Non-synthesizable Constructs:**
        - Definition: SystemVerilog code primarily used for verification, testbenches, or high-level modeling that cannot be directly implemented in hardware by synthesis tools.
        - Examples of Non-synthesizable Constructs:
            - `initial` blocks (primarily for testbench initialization).
            - `fork-join` (for parallel simulation constructs).
            - Delays (`#delay`).
            - File I/O operations (`$fopen`, `$fwrite`, `$fclose`).
            - System tasks for display and simulation control (`$display`, `$monitor`, `$finish`, `$stop`).
            - Complex data types and abstract data structures (beyond basic arrays and structs).
            - Certain types of loops (e.g., unbounded loops, loops dependent on simulation time).
        - Purpose of Non-synthesizable Constructs:  Used for creating test environments, controlling simulation flow, and modeling system behavior at a higher level of abstraction for verification purposes.
    *   **Importance of Distinction:** Understanding the difference is critical to write RTL code that can be implemented in hardware.  Mixing synthesizable and non-synthesizable code in RTL modules will lead to synthesis errors or unexpected behavior.

*   **Coding for Synthesis: `always` blocks, `assign` statements, instantiation:**
    *   **`always` Blocks:**
        - `always_comb`:  For combinational logic.
            - Inference of combinational logic:  When all inputs to an `always_comb` block change, the output should update immediately (in zero simulation time).
            - Sensitivity list: Implicitly sensitive to all input signals read within the block. Avoid explicit sensitivity lists in `always_comb`.
            - Use blocking assignments (`=`) within `always_comb`.
            - Example:
                ```SV
                always_comb begin
                    y = (sel == 1'b1) ? a : b;
                end
                ```
        - `always_ff`: For sequential logic (flip-flops and registers).
            - Clocked behavior:  Code inside `always_ff` executes only at the specified clock edge (e.g., `posedge clk`, `negedge clk`).
            - Sensitivity list: Must include the clock edge event (e.g., `@(posedge clk)`). Can optionally include reset events.
            - Use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) within `always_ff`.
            - Example (D flip-flop with synchronous reset):
                ```SV
                always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
                    if (rst) begin
                        q <= 1'b0;
                    end else begin
                        q <= d;
                    end
                end
                ```
        - `always_latch` (generally discouraged for synthesis):
            - Level-sensitive behavior, infers latches.
            - Can be used intentionally in specific cases, but often leads to timing problems and is harder to control than flip-flops.
            - If used, sensitivity list should include all input signals.
    *   **`assign` Statements:**
        - Continuous assignment:  Used for describing combinational logic where the output is a direct function of the inputs.
        - Implicitly sensitive to all signals on the right-hand side.
        - Example:
            ```SV
            assign sum = a + b;
            assign carry_out = carry_in & a | carry_in & b | a & b;
            ```
        - Suitable for simple combinational logic expressions.
    *   **Instantiation:**
        - Hierarchical design:  Creating modules and instantiating them within other modules to build complex systems.
        - Instantiating user-defined modules and library primitives (e.g., flip-flops, gates from technology libraries).
        - Example:
            ```SV
            module top_module;
                wire internal_wire;
                sub_module instance1 (
                    .input_port(input_signal),
                    .output_port(internal_wire)
                );
                // ... use internal_wire ...
            endmodule
            ```

*   **RTL Coding Styles for Different Types of Logic:**
    *   **Combinational Logic:**
        - Use `always_comb` blocks or `assign` statements.
        - Ensure complete specification: In `always_comb` blocks, assign values to all outputs under all possible input conditions (use `else` or `default` in `if-else` or `case` statements to avoid unintended latches).
        - Avoid unintended state retention (latches): Be careful not to create memory elements unintentionally in combinational logic blocks.
    *   **Sequential Logic:**
        - Use `always_ff` blocks with appropriate clock edge sensitivity (`@(posedge clk)` or `@(negedge clk)`).
        - Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) are essential within `always_ff` for correct sequential behavior.
        - Reset implementation: Include reset logic (synchronous or asynchronous) within `always_ff` to initialize registers.
        - Example (Synchronous Reset Counter):
            ```SV
            always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
                if (rst) begin
                    count <= 4'b0;
                end else begin
                    count <= count + 1'b1;
                end
            end
            ```
    *   **Finite State Machines (FSMs):**
        - Separate `always_ff` block for state register update and `always_comb` block for next-state and output logic.
        - Use enumerated types (`enum`) for states to improve readability and prevent coding errors.
        - Use `case` statement for state transitions in `always_comb` block.
        - Include a `default` case in the `case` statement to handle unexpected states (for robustness).
        - Example (Moore FSM):
            ```SV
            typedef enum logic [1:0] {S_IDLE, S_STATE1, S_STATE2} state_t;
            state_t current_state, next_state;

            always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
                if (rst) begin
                    current_state <= S_IDLE;
                end else begin
                    current_state <= next_state;
                end
            end

            always_comb begin
                next_state = current_state; // Default next state
                case (current_state)
                    S_IDLE: begin
                        if (start_condition) next_state = S_STATE1;
                    end
                    S_STATE1: begin
                        next_state = S_STATE2;
                    end
                    S_STATE2: begin
                        if (end_condition) next_state = S_IDLE;
                    end
                    default: next_state = S_IDLE; // Handle unexpected states
                endcase
            end

            assign output_signal = (current_state == S_STATE2); // Output logic
            ```
    *   **Memories (Block RAMs):**
        - Instantiation of memory primitives provided by FPGA/ASIC vendors.
        - Refer to vendor-specific documentation for memory instantiation templates and parameters (e.g., Xilinx Block RAM, Intel on-chip memory).
        - Example (Conceptual - vendor-specific instantiation will vary):
            ```SV
            // Conceptual example - not actual vendor-specific code
            memory_block #(
                .DATA_WIDTH(32),
                .ADDR_WIDTH(10),
                .NUM_WORDS(1024)
            ) mem_instance (
                .clk(clk),
                .addr(mem_address),
                .data_in(write_data),
                .data_out(read_data),
                .we(write_enable),
                .re(read_enable)
            );
            ```

*   **Parameterization and Code Reusability:**
    *   **Parameters:**
        - Defining parameters in modules: `parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8;`
        - Using parameters to make modules configurable and reusable for different data widths, memory sizes, etc.
        - Overriding parameters during module instantiation.
        - Example:
            ```SV
            module parameterized_adder #(parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8) (
                input logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] a, b,
                output logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] sum
            );
                assign sum = a + b;
            endmodule

            module top_module;
                parameterized_adder #(.DATA_WIDTH(16)) adder_16bit ( ... ); // Instantiate with 16-bit width
                parameterized_adder #(.DATA_WIDTH(32)) adder_32bit ( ... ); // Instantiate with 32-bit width
            endmodule
            ```
    *   **Generate Statements:**
        - Conditional generation (`if-generate`):  Generate code blocks based on parameter values or conditions.
        - Loop generation (`for-generate`):  Generate repetitive code structures, useful for arrays of instances or parameterized logic.
        - Example (`for-generate` for array of adders):
            ```SV
            module generate_example #(parameter NUM_ADDERS = 4) (
                input logic [7:0] in [NUM_ADDERS],
                output logic [7:0] out [NUM_ADDERS]
            );
                genvar i;
                generate
                    for (i = 0; i < NUM_ADDERS; i = i + 1) begin : adder_loop
                        adder_instance adder_i (
                            .a(in[i]),
                            .b(8'b1),
                            .sum(out[i])
                        );
                    end
                endgenerate
            endmodule
            ```
    *   **Benefits of Parameterization and Generate:**
        - Code reuse:  Write generic modules that can be adapted to different requirements.
        - Reduced code duplication.
        - Easier maintenance and modification.

*   **Coding for Readability and Maintainability:**
    *   **Comments:**
        - Adding comments to explain the purpose of modules, blocks of code, and complex logic.
        - Commenting parameters, ports, and important signals.
        - Keeping comments up-to-date with code changes.
    *   **Naming Conventions:**
        - Using meaningful and consistent names for modules, signals, variables, parameters, and states.
        - Common conventions: `clk` for clock, `rst` for reset, `en` for enable, `_i` for input, `_o` for output, `_reg` for registers, `_wire` for wires.
        - Consistency within a project or team.
    *   **Modular Design (Hierarchy):**
        - Breaking down complex designs into smaller, manageable modules.
        - Creating a hierarchical structure with well-defined interfaces between modules.
        - Top-down or bottom-up design approaches.
        - Benefits: Easier to understand, design, verify, and reuse individual modules.

*   **Coding for Performance and Area Optimization (Basic Strategies):**
    *   **Performance (Speed):**
        - Pipelining:  Breaking long combinational paths into stages with registers in between to increase clock frequency (covered in detail in later chapters).
        - Minimize combinational logic in critical paths:  Reduce the complexity of logic between registers to shorten propagation delays.
        - Register balancing:  Distribute registers to balance delays in different paths.
        - Careful use of arithmetic operations:  Multiplication and division can be slow and area-consuming. Consider alternatives if performance is critical.
    *   **Area (Resource Utilization):**
        - Resource sharing:  Reuse hardware resources (e.g., ALUs) when possible.
        - Minimize register usage:  Registers consume area and power. Use registers only when necessary for sequential behavior.
        - Optimize logic complexity:  Simplify Boolean expressions and logic functions to reduce gate count.
        - Consider trade-offs: Performance and area often have trade-offs. Optimize based on design requirements.
    *   **Note:** Detailed optimization techniques are often tool-dependent and are explored further during synthesis and implementation. RTL coding provides the initial foundation for optimization.

*   **Common RTL Coding Errors and Pitfalls:**
    *   **Unintentional Latches:**
        - Incomplete `if-else` or `case` statements in `always_comb` blocks where outputs are not assigned in all conditions.
        - Example (Latch Inference - Avoid):
            ```SV
            always_comb begin
                if (enable) begin
                    q = d; // Latch inferred if 'enable' is not true
                end
            end
            ```
        - Solution: Ensure all outputs are assigned in all branches of conditional statements in `always_comb`. Use `else` or `default`.
    *   **Blocking vs. Non-blocking Assignments Misuse:**
        - Incorrect use of blocking (`=`) in `always_ff` or non-blocking (`<=`) in `always_comb`.
        - Rule of thumb: Use non-blocking in `always_ff` (sequential), blocking in `always_comb` (combinational).
    *   **Sensitivity List Errors (especially with `always` blocks - avoid `always @*` in modern SystemVerilog, use `always_comb` and `always_ff`):**
        - Missing signals in sensitivity lists of `always` blocks (if manually specified).
        - Redundant signals in sensitivity lists.
    *   **Incorrect Reset Implementation:**
        - Asynchronous reset issues (glitches, metastability if not handled properly).
        - Synchronous reset best practices:  Generally preferred for simpler timing analysis and predictable behavior.
    *   **Integer Division and Modulo Operations:**
        - Synthesis of division and modulo can be resource-intensive, especially for variable divisors.
        - Consider alternatives or approximations if performance/area is critical.
    *   **Over-specification or Under-specification:**
        - Over-specification:  Unnecessarily complex code that might limit synthesis optimization.
        - Under-specification:  Ambiguous code that can lead to different interpretations by synthesis tools or simulation mismatches.

## Exercises

*   **Rewrite poorly written RTL code snippets to improve readability and synthesizability:**
    *   **Provide Examples of Poor Code:** The instructor should provide several short snippets of poorly written RTL code that violate coding style guidelines and may have synthesis or simulation issues (e.g., unintended latches, incorrect sensitivity lists, unclear logic).
    *   **Task:**  For each snippet, the trainee engineer should:
        - Identify the coding style issues and potential problems.
        - Rewrite the code snippet to improve readability, synthesizability, and correctness, applying the best practices learned in the chapter.
        - Explain the improvements made and why the rewritten code is better.
    *   **Example Snippet (Poor):**
        ```SV
        module bad_mux(input a, b, sel, output q);
            reg q;
            always @ (a or b or sel)
            begin
                if (sel)
                    q = a;
            end
        endmodule
        ```
    *   **Rewritten (Improved):**
        ```SV
        module good_mux(input logic a, b, sel, output logic q);
            always_comb begin
                if (sel) begin
                    q = a;
                end else begin
                    q = b; // Added else to avoid latch
                end
            end
        endmodule
        ```

*   **Design a simple arithmetic logic unit (ALU) using good RTL coding practices:**
    *   **ALU Functionality:** Design an ALU that can perform a set of basic arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, NOT).
    *   **Control Signals:** Define control signals to select the operation to be performed by the ALU.
    *   **RTL Implementation:**
        - Use `always_comb` blocks for combinational logic within the ALU.
        - Use `case` statement to implement the different operations based on control signals.
        - Apply good naming conventions, comments, and modularity.
    *   **Verification:** Write a simple testbench to verify the ALU functionality for all supported operations.

*   **Experiment with different coding styles for the same functionality and compare synthesis results (area, timing):**
    *   **Choose a Simple Circuit:** Select a relatively simple combinational or sequential circuit (e.g., a small adder, a multiplexer tree, a counter).
    *   **Implement in Different Styles:** Implement the same circuit in at least two different coding styles, for example:
        - Style 1: Using nested `if-else` statements vs. `case` statement.
        - Style 2: Using `assign` statements vs. `always_comb` block for combinational logic.
        - Style 3: Different ways of implementing reset (synchronous vs. asynchronous).
    *   **Synthesize the Designs:** Use a synthesis tool (e.g., Vivado Synthesis or Quartus Prime) to synthesize each implementation of the circuit.
    *   **Compare Synthesis Reports:** Analyze the synthesis reports for each implementation, focusing on:
        - Area (resource utilization - LUTs, flip-flops, etc.).
        - Timing (critical path delay, maximum frequency).
    *   **Analyze Results:**  Discuss and compare the synthesis results for different coding styles. Observe how coding style can impact area and performance. Understand that there is often a trade-off and the "best" style might depend on specific design goals and tool optimizations.
