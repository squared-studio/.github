This chapter culminates the course with a comprehensive verification project that allows you to apply all the UVM-based verification techniques learned throughout the semester.  In addition to the project, we will explore a selection of advanced verification topics, providing a glimpse into specialized and emerging areas within the field. This chapter aims to solidify your understanding of practical verification methodologies and broaden your awareness of the evolving landscape of hardware verification.

*   **Verification Project: Comprehensive Verification of a Moderately Complex RTL Design:**
    *   **Project Scope and Objectives:** This chapter centers around a significant verification project where you will take on the role of a verification engineer to comprehensively verify a moderately complex RTL design. The project is designed to be a practical application of all the UVM, constrained-random verification, functional coverage, and assertion-based verification techniques you have learned in previous modules.
    *   **Example RTL Designs (Project Options):** You can choose to verify one of the following example RTL designs (or another design of comparable complexity, subject to instructor approval):
        - **Simplified RISC-V Processor Pipeline:**
            - **Functionality:** A basic in-order RISC-V processor pipeline, implementing a subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (e.g., integer instructions, load/store). The pipeline could include stages like instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back.
            - **Verification Challenges:**  Pipeline control logic, data forwarding, hazard detection and handling, instruction execution correctness, memory interface interactions.
        - **Basic Memory Controller:**
            - **Functionality:** A simplified memory controller managing access to a memory array (e.g., SDRAM or DDR). Features could include address mapping, command processing (read, write), refresh operations, and basic arbitration.
            - **Verification Challenges:**  Memory access protocols, timing constraints, arbitration logic, data integrity, error handling (if included).
        - **AMBA Bus Interface (AHB or AXI Lite):**
            - **Functionality:** An interface module implementing a subset of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) AHB or AXI Lite protocol. This chapter would handle bus transactions as a master or slave interface.
            - **Verification Challenges:**  Bus protocol compliance (addressing, data transfer, handshake signals), arbitration (if master interface), error responses, timing requirements of the bus protocol.
